## Description

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the **US annual "County Health Rankings" dataset**. The primary objective is to estimate premature deaths (defined as the number of deaths occurring under the age of 75). To achieve this, I analyzed several variables in the dataset that provide insight into premature death, including **Teen Birth Rate, Violent Crime Rate, and Percentage of Smokers**.
